Coursera Capstone Project Data Overview In order to help our client determine which city to open their coffee store in, we will use the following methods with Foursquare data:*We will pull data on popular venues in the surrounding areas of Boise and Spokane. We will look at the number of venues, the types of venues, and the physical proximity of those venues to our location.*We will then identify 3 similar coffee shops in 3 different cities and pull data on popular nearby venues, specifically looking number of venues, types of venues and their proximity to the respective coffee cafes. We will use this data to identify indicators of optimal locations for opening successful cafes in small-midsize US cities.*Using aggregated data from the  other 3 cities, we will help the client select the better downtown area for opening their own coffee shop.
